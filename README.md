# TODO Task

* While I am no productivity expert, I have benefitted hugely from keeping daily TODO Task. From my experience, I thought of listing a few tips on how you could make the practice work even better for you.
* Create a registration page and SignIn page.
* After login by default the user will see all his tasks created in the last 15 days.( only
  heading of the todo task.). Use different colors or some other highlighter for different
  status.
* User can filter his/her tasks based on creation date, status (pending ,completed, on hold)
* Create a Todo task. Users can create a new task. Which will have at least below
  mentioned fields. You can use more according to your requirements.
* Edit task- User can edit details of the task which has been created earlier. Editable fields
  are - Heading, Description, File and status of task (mark as complete or on hold).
